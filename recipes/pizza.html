    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Grilling pizza is an excellent way to enjoy homemade pizza with a crispy crust and perfectly melted toppings.
        The intense heat of a hot grill closely mimics that of a professional pizza oven, allowing you to achieve that sought-after charred flavor and texture. 
        Our recipe will guide you through the steps to make and grill pizza from scratch, ensuring a delicious result every time. 
        Whether you're a fan of classic Margherita or love experimenting with bold and unique toppings, this method is versatile enough to accommodate all your culinary desires.</p>

    <p>One key tip when grilling pizza is to be mindful of the toppings. 
        While it might be tempting to load up your pizza with an abundance of ingredients, a lighter touch is often better. 
        Too many toppings can weigh down the dough and prevent it from cooking evenly. By keeping it simple and balanced, you’ll ensure a perfectly cooked pizza with a delightful balance of flavors. 
        So fire up the grill, gather your favorite ingredients, and get ready to enjoy a delightful pizza experience right in your backyard!</p>

        <p><img src="./images/step5doughoil.jpg" alt="Image of Ingredients on a table" height="400" width="500"></p>
        <li>Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled again.</li>

        <li>Make pizzas: Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.</li>
